The data scraped from [https://www.lacentrale.fr/](https://www.lacentrale.fr/) is used for educational and demonstrative purposes, and adherence to the website's terms of service and policies is maintained.

**Note**: If this project is accessible via a GitHub repository, please ensure that it is used strictly for educational purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Project Overview

PricePilot is a tool designed to predict car prices based on various factors like brand, mileage, and more. It provides a simulated environment for learning about data science and machine learning, particularly in the context of vehicle pricing predictions.

## Setup Instructions

To set up PricePilot for educational purposes, follow these steps:

### 1. Configuration

- Copy the `.env.example` file into a new file named `.env` in both the project root and the `price-pilot` folder:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  Fill in the necessary variables in the `.env` files. These files will hold important configuration information for your application.

### 2. Install Backend Requirements

- Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip in the project root:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Install Frontend Requirements

- Navigate to the `price-pilot` folder and install the frontend dependencies listed in `package.json` using npm:

  ```bash
  cd price-pilot
  npm install
  ```

### 4. Database Configuration

- PricePilot uses MongoDB as the database. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running or use [MongoAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).

### 5. Run Migrations

- Run the database migrations to set up the initial database schema in the project root:

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

### 6. Run the Backend Server

- Start the development server in the project root:

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### 7. Run the Frontend Server

- Start the frontend server in the `price-pilot` folder:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

ðŸ›« PricePilot is now ready for takeoff! Access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and explore the world of predicted car prices for educational purposes.

### Frontend

The frontend of PricePilot is located in the `price-pilot` folder. It is a React-powered application with the following key technologies:

- **React**: The UI is built using React, providing an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Vite**: Vite is used for fast, efficient development and building of the frontend.

The `package.json` file contains all the necessary dependencies for the frontend. Additionally, an `.env` file is required in the `price-pilot` folder for environment-specific configurations. There's a `price-pilot/.env.example` for reference.
