# PricePilot - For Educational Purposes Only

ðŸš€ **PricePilot - Your Vehicle Pricing Navigator (Educational Purpose)**

Welcome to PricePilot, a project developed for educational purposes, showcasing the integration of web scraping, data management, and predictive analysis. This project demonstrates how to scrape data from [https://www.lacentrale.fr/](https://www.lacentrale.fr/) and store it in a database, with a focus on predicting car prices using advanced AI algorithms.

## Disclaimer

This project, PricePilot, is intended for educational use only. It serves as a learning tool to demonstrate the concepts of web scraping, data storage, and machine learning. The data scraped from [https://www.lacentrale.fr/](https://www.lacentrale.fr/) is used for educational and demonstrative purposes, and adherence to the website's terms of service and policies is maintained.

**Note**: If this project is accessible via a GitHub repository, please ensure that it is used strictly for educational purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Project Overview

PricePilot is a tool designed to predict car prices based on various factors like brand, mileage, and more. It provides a simulated environment for learning about data science and machine learning, particularly in the context of vehicle pricing predictions.

## Setup Instructions

To set up PricePilot for educational purposes, follow these steps:

### 1. Configuration

- Copy the `.env.example` file into a new file named `.env`:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  Fill in the necessary variables in the `.env` file. This file will hold important configuration information for your application.

### 2. Install Requirements
